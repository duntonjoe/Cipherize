Plan for developing cipherize:
------------------------------

1) cool intro screen, use figlet to generate a text file, print to screen.
2) interactive menu that allows you to pick a cipher to encode/decode from


Possible ciphers:
------------------
Basic Caesar
Polybius Square
Rot13
ASCII pigpen cipher? (would be super cool)
