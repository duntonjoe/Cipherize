The caesar cipher is a textbook example of monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.
This "encodes" your message by mapping a standard output to a shifed output.
Here's an example of the alphabet with a shift of 1:

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v
z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y

So, if we encode the word "apple", we get "zookd" back.


You may note that the bottom letters are shifted in a 
circular manner. (e.g. "Z" wrapped back to the "A" 
position when shifted) This means that if we shift 
a given message by X places, then shift if again
by (26 - X), we end up with out plaintext again!
This is due to the Obvious fact that:
 
(X + [26 - X]) = 26 

in every situation where X is bound to the range (0, 26). 
This simple proof allows us to brute force the cipher by 
just re-encrypting the ciphertext with every possible key, 
and seeing which key returns actual language back.
